# dizklosure ‚Ä¢ ![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/sambarnes/dizklosure?label=license)

A primitive credentialing system w/ selective disclosure. Written in [noir](https://github.com/noir-lang/noir), a DSL for zk circuits.

The government makes a claim that Alice was born on a given day. This claim, as well as the government's signature covering the claim, is stored off chain.

Bob wants to gate some action on his users being over 21 (i.e. born before a given day, 21 years ago).

With this circuit, Alice can prove the government claims she was born on *some* day before the cutoff, without revealing what day that is.

## Development

To setup the noir toolchain, use [noirup](https://github.com/noir-lang/noirup).

We'll specifically need to use a dev branch, since support for ecdsa over secp256k1 is not yet released.

```bash
noirup --branch aztec3-hacky
```

To test the circuit, use nargo:

```bash
cd circuits
nargo test
```

## TODO

* Fix `nargo prove p` and `nargo verify p`, currently broken here ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
* Wait for `nargo codegen-verifier` to be fixed with ecdsa sigs
* Integrate foundry into the test framework, building off of [nplate](https://github.com/whitenois3/nplate)

tl;dr shits barely tested let alone audited -- not for prod
